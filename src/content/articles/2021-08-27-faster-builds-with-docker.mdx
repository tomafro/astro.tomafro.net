title: Fast build dependencies with docker
draft: true
---

Recently at [farill.io](https://farill.io) we've rewritten our CI pipeline, moving from [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) to [buildkite](https://buildkite.com). Our builds should finish as quickly as possible, so we've split them into several discrete steps, many of which can run in parallel. Each step runs in a dedicated docker container (via the [buildkite docker-compose plugin](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/docker-compose-buildkite-plugin)), sharing nothing with other steps in the pipeline. To keep the build fast they must start up as fast as possible, so we use a special builder image that already includes all tools and dependencies (such as gems, javascript modules, clojure libraries, etc).

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:20.04 AS base

# ...install all the tools needed for the build, such as
# ruby, node, yarn, etc...

ENV GEM_HOME ${HOME}/ruby/gems
ENV BUNDLE_PATH ${HOME}/ruby/bundle
ENV BUNDLE_BIN ${HOME}/ruby/bin

FROM base AS ruby

COPY Gemfile Gemfile
COPY Gemfile.lock Gemfile.lock
RUN bundle install

FROM base AS build

COPY --from=ruby ${GEM_HOME} ${GEM_HOME}
COPY --from=ruby ${BUNDLE_BIN} ${BUNDLE_BIN}
```
