    Very short weeknotes this week, mainly because I spent _hours_ on Sunday getting a new insulin cannula into Frances, only for her glucose levels to continue to rise. Up until 2am checking blood sugar, realising the cannula was kinked, inserting a different cannula, calculating correction doses, etc. The whole awful saga dragged on until Monday lunchtime (should that be in next week's notes?). Not much time for anything else.

    Kept up the exercise, with two runs and a PT session. For the first time Danie and I went to the personal trainer together. Worked really well, the session felt shorter, and we got to get some tasty lunch from [Pavilion](https://pavilionbakery.com/) afterwards.
