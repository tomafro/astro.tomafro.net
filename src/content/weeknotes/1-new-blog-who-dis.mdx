* [Re-written my blog](https://github.com/tomafro/astro.tomafro.net) for maybe the 1000th time, this time using [Astro 2.0](https://astro.build). Although Astro can do more, I just want a simple static site, and it's been a pretty decent experience so far. Only a few quirks and minor obstacles to overcome, and to my eyes everything seems logical and well thought through. I'm going to try and write some (sparse) weeknotes, import as many posts from older versions of my blog as I can, and generally get my shit together more.

* Last Sunday it took *more than 6 hours* to cancel my Virgin Media broadband, but the saga still wasn't over. Danie got 5 calls from their retention team on Monday before picking up.

  *"I can offer better deals than our normal agents can make".*

  The thing is, I don't want the hassle of pretending to cancel every couple of years just to get a decent deal. It's their way of offering price discrimination, but it's awful for customers and I hate it. I'm with [Community Fibre](https://communityfibre.co.uk/) now, who will have to go some way to be as painful as Virgin have been.

* Kids watching [The Lion Guard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion_Guard) on Disney Plus, set in the 'innocent' world of the Lion King. Except the current series seems to be about the main character's developing drug dependency. Quick search shows I'm [not the first person](https://www.reddit.com/r/LionGuard/comments/p1ls5q/tlg_season_3_is_all_about_drugs_heres_why/) to have thought this.

* Managing Frances's diabetes has generally been fine but hard work, for everything except when we need to change the position of her infusion set. Every three days we need to do this, moving the point where the insulin from her pump enters her body, giving the existing location time to refresh and heal. But she hates the *thought* of the new injection so much, it takes hours of distress and negotiation to make the change.

* Took my nephew to [the biggest Lego Store in the World](https://www.lego.com/en-au/aboutus/news/2022/august/lego-store-in-leicester-square) in Leicester Square as his birthday present. I think it went well.
