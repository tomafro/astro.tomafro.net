* Ran twice this week, for the first time in ages! From running more than 200km the month before my daughter was diagnosed with T1, to way less than half that in the three months since. Finading the time to get out has been so difficult. It affects my mood, both the lack of day-to-day exercise, but also the general feeling of unfitness lingering over me. Determined to somehow get back into it more regularly. Watch this space (or rather Strava).

* Been watching [Poker Face](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker_Face_(TV_series)) (the Rian Johnson/Natasha Lyonne series, not the Ant and Dec gameshow). I really like that every episode is self-contained, that every detail is important in that particular episode, that it knows just what it is (a 'case of the week' detective series) and doesn't try to be anything more.

* Also saw [Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant-Man_and_the_Wasp:_Quantumania) with my son. Fred said he liked it (though was less effusive than with other films we've seen), but man I was so bored. We're constantly told the stakes are incredibly high, yet they *feel* tiny. I'm 100% in the Scorcese[^1] camp:

  *"What’s not there is revelation, mystery or genuine emotional danger. Nothing is at risk."*

* Loads of palaver getting my daughter's diabetes medication sorted. While we have _loads_ of insulin, it's not in the right vials for her Ypsopump. That takes small vials which we have to manually fill, but we're running short on the empty containers. The pump also takes pre-filled vials which we'd prefer, but every time we've tried to request them something gets lost in translation. We ask the GP, who then ask the pharmacy, who then order from their supplier. And a week later we pick up the prescription only to find that while it's the correct insulin, it's for a pen not a pump. So we try again...

* Done a fair bit of tinkering on this site, partly to clean things up, partly to play around with new shiny things. It took me a little while to get my head around the way astro adds styles to components, but I think I like it. You define a component like this:
  ```astro
  <style>
    h1 {
      color: red;
    }
  </style>
  <hgroup>
    <h1>Title</h1>
  </hgroup>
  ```
  Astro will split the stylesheet out from the markup, generate markup:
  ```html
  <hgroup class="astro-ABCDEFGH">
    <h1 class="astro-ABCDEFGH">Title</h1>
  </hgroup>
  ```
  And css:
  ```css
  h1:where(.astro-ABCDEFGH) {
    color: red;
  }
  ```
  So the styles are scoped only to markup generated by the component, not all `h1` elements on the page. All this is automatic. I like it, it makes styling these components much easier not having to worry as much about style clashes, and the generated static site is still slick enough for me.

* A new OS feature I'd like: 'What the beep?'. It's purpose is simple. Whenever an app makes a sound, the OS adds it to a list you can go back and review. 'What the beep was that?' 'A new notification on the Mastondon web page'
