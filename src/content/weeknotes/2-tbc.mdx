* I've done a fair bit of tinkering on this website, partly to clean things up, partly to play around with new shiny things. It took me a little while to get my head around the way astro adds styles to components, but I think I like it. You define a component like this:
  ```astro
  <style>
    h1 {
      color: red;
    }
  </style>
  <hgroup>
    <h1>Title</h1>
  </hgroup>
  ```
  Astro will split the stylesheet out from the markup, generate markup:
  ```html
  <hgroup class="astro-ABCDEFGH">
    <h1 class="astro-ABCDEFGH">Title</h1>
  </hgroup>
  ```
  And css:
  ```css
  h1:where(.astro-ABCDEFGH) {
    color: red;
  }
  ```
  So the styles are scoped only to markup generated by the component, not all `h1` elements on the page. All this is automatic.

* Loads of palava getting insulin for my daughter this week. It's easy getting hold of insulin, but getting it in the right form for the Ypsopump she uses is much tricker. It takes small vials, but whenever we request some pre-filled, we end up with the completely wrong size (we always get given insulin for injecting pens). Something seems to get lost in translation between the pharmacy and the GP. So we're left manually filling up our own reservoirs.

* I've been wondering if other people add random words to their quick and dirty `println` debugging? I often use animals:
  ```ruby
  puts "AARDVARK " + result.inspect
  ```

  Or when the code is really pissing me off, I swear:

  ```ruby
  puts "FUCK!! " + result.inspect
  ```

* Thought up a new OS feature I'd like: 'What the beep?'. It's purpose is simple. Whenever an app makes a sound, the OS adds it to a list you can go back and review. 'What the beep was that?' 'A new notification on the Mastondon web page'
