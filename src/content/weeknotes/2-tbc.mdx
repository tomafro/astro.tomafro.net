* This week I've tweaked this blog to use css container queries.

* Do other people add random words to their quick and dirty `println` debugging?

  ```ruby
  puts "AARDVARK " + result.inspect
  ```

  Or when it's really pissing me off:

  ```ruby
  puts "FUCK!! " + result.inspect
  ```

* An OS feature I'd like: 'What made that beep?'.
