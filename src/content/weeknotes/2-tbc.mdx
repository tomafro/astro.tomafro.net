* Loads of palaver getting my daughter's diabetes medication sorted. While we have _loads_ of insulin, it's not in the right vials for her Ypsopump. That takes small vials which we have to manually fill, but we're running short on the empty containers. The pump also takes pre-filled vials which we'd prefer, but every time we've tried to request them something gets lost in translation. We ask the GP, who then ask the pharmacy, who then order from their supplier. And a week later we pick up the prescription only to find that while it's the correct insulin, it's for a pen not a pump. So we try again...

* Done a fair bit of tinkering on this site, partly to clean things up, partly to play around with new shiny things. It took me a little while to get my head around the way astro adds styles to components, but I think I like it. You define a component like this:
  ```astro
  <style>
    h1 {
      color: red;
    }
  </style>
  <hgroup>
    <h1>Title</h1>
  </hgroup>
  ```
  Astro will split the stylesheet out from the markup, generate markup:
  ```html
  <hgroup class="astro-ABCDEFGH">
    <h1 class="astro-ABCDEFGH">Title</h1>
  </hgroup>
  ```
  And css:
  ```css
  h1:where(.astro-ABCDEFGH) {
    color: red;
  }
  ```
  So the styles are scoped only to markup generated by the component, not all `h1` elements on the page. All this is automatic.

* Thought up a new OS feature I'd like: 'What the beep?'. It's purpose is simple. Whenever an app makes a sound, the OS adds it to a list you can go back and review. 'What the beep was that?' 'A new notification on the Mastondon web page'

* I've been wondering if other people add random words to their quick and dirty `println` debugging? I often use animals:
  ```ruby
  puts "AARDVARK " + result.inspect
  ```

  Or when the code is really pissing me off, I swear:

  ```ruby
  puts "FUCK!! " + result.inspect
  ```
