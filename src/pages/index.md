I'm Tom Ward, a London based software developer, currently working for [Farillio](https://farill.io).

Previously I spent 5 years working as a programmer at [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com), where amongst many things I wrote their first Android app, built large parts of the Basecamp 3 backend, and laid the foundations for [Hey.com](https://hey.com).

Before joining Basecamp I was a partner at [Go Free Range](https://gofreerange.com), a collective of talented, like-minded developers.

We built the government part of [GOV.UK](https://gov.uk), replacing [all UK ministerial department websites](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations).

We worked with a small team at the Open University to launch [FutureLearn](https://futurelearn.com) as a successful online learning provider, hosting courses up to degree level.

We also worked with other clients including [Mubi](https://mubi.com), [O2](https://o2.com) and [many more](https://gofreerange.com/projects).

Feel free to give me a shout about anything [on mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@tomafro), [twitter](https://twitter.com/tomafro) or [via email](mailto:tom@popdog.net).
